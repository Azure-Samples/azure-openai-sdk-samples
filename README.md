# Azure OpenAI SDK Samples

The main purpose of these samples is to show usage scenarios for Azure OpenAI, beyond what a quickstart might demonstrate while also not being scenario-complete experiences (e.g. an app that's "end-user ready"). As is often the case for software projects, these implementations are not written to be the only (or the best!) way to reach the goal. We hope these will be helpful for those familiarizing with the usages and workflows when building AI-related projects - and maybe even spark new ideas!

## Repo overview

Samples are have a top-level directory of the scenario name. If a sample has been adapted for multiple languanges, each of those languages will then have their own subdirectory. For example:

- /SomeSample1/.NET
- /SomeSample1/Java
- etc.

> [!TIP]
> This repo will continually be updated - as we add more samples, to avoid taking unneeded storage space, consider using a [sparse checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) to clone only the sample you're interested in!
